# Creating A Submarine Swaps Broker Platform
> This repository builds step-by-step a Submarine Swaps Broker Platform in Golang.

With this repository you can build a broker platform as a web application for Submarine Swaps. It allows swapping of on-chain bitcoins to off-chain payments without trust in the middleman called a broker. The inspiration to this application came from the [/submarineswaps/swaps-service](https://github.com/submarineswaps/swaps-service) repository written in Javascript by Alex Bosworth.

You can follow along each step by reading through the articles found inside [/docs/articles](docs/articles) or at my blog [https://bjarnemagnussen.netlify.com](https://bjarnemagnussen.netlify.com/tags/subswap.dev/).

Towards the end of this article series the broker platform will look a bit like:
